🐍 Python Basics – Theory Notes

1️⃣ Conditional Statements (Decision Making)
Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions.

if Statement: Executes code only if the condition is True.
Example:

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")


if–else Statement: Chooses between two options.

age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You cannot vote")


if–elif–else Statement: Used for multiple conditions.

marks = 75
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Grade C")


Nested if: if inside another if, used when one condition depends on another.

age = 20
ll = "yes"
if age >= 18:
    if ll == "yes":
        print("Apply for DL")


💡 Tip: Use >= instead of > if you want to handle equal values too.

2️⃣ Strings 📝
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes ' ' or " ".

name = "Atharva"


Common String Operations:

len(name) → length of string

"Hello " + name → concatenation

name * 2 → repetition

name[0] → first character

name[0:3] → slicing

name.lower() → lowercase

name.upper() → uppercase

name.count("a") → count occurrences

💡 Strings are immutable – cannot change a character directly.

3️⃣ Functions 🔧
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 3))


Tip:

def → defines a function

return → sends output

Functions can take parameters (inputs)

4️⃣ Operators ⚡

Arithmetic Operators:
+ addition, - subtraction, * multiply, / divide, // floor divide, % modulus, ** power

Comparison Operators:
== equal, != not equal, > greater, < less, >= greater or equal, <= less or equal

Logical Operators:
and True if both conditions True, or True if any condition True, not inverts Boolean

Assignment Operators:
= assign, += add and assign, -= subtract and assign, *= multiply and assign, /= divide and assign

🎯 Quick Tips:

Always indent after if, elif, else, def

Use .lower() or .upper() to normalize string inputs

Use % operator to check even, odd, or multiples

Nested if is useful when one condition depends on another
